# train-yolov4-tiny-colab
Train a darknet yolov4-tiny on a google colab to have weights and configs to build a OAK-one blob in the next step

This colab is mostly based on yolo4v-tiny: https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-ml-training/tree/master/colab-notebooks#tiny-yolov4-object-detector-training-

I divided this excellent colab into two devisions to seperate training from converting.

# This is the training part

You do not have to edit any files, make the changes within the colab.
Start the training by pressing the colab button.
